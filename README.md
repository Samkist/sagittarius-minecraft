# Sagittarius  Overview
A Java Library for distributed minecraft plugin programming

Sagittarius Minecraft is named after the supermassive blackhole in the center of the MilkyWay, accordingly named Sagittarius A* (_Pronounced Sagittarius A Star_)

Sagittarius is a fun project that myself an a classmate Cody Botte worked on in order to 
better our understanding of APIs, Multithreading, Networking, and The Spigot API.
